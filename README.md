GitHub Actions CI/CD Lab
This lab demonstrates a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, integrating various tools for code quality, security, and containerization, culminating in application deployment to an EKS Kubernetes cluster.

Objectives & Key Features
GitHub Actions Fundamentals: Learn to build CI/CD pipelines from scratch, leveraging both shared and self-hosted runners.
DevSecOps Tooling: Integrate Trivy for vulnerability scanning, GitLeakes for sensitive data detection, and SonarQube for code quality analysis.
Containerization & Orchestration: Implement Docker jobs for image building/pushing and deploy applications to an Amazon EKS Kubernetes cluster.
YAML-driven Pipelines: Emphasize writing CI/CD configurations from scratch
